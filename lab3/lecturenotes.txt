cos(declination) ~ 1
fringe frequency = B/lambduh
morlet wavelet transform - special for when frequency depends on time like the fringe!
want intensity vs time and frequency and...yeah
one way:
divide wave that has frequency time dependence, take chunks and do fft. It's for poor people.
Morlet transform convolves the time series with a Gaussian multiplied by a sine wave. real part is centered on gaussian, imaginary part is the sine equivalent of the cosine.
keep number of wavelengths in gaussian the same, and convolve with different widths of gaussians.
fringe frquency vs hour angle, get sinx/x function
pattern in sky moves at rate of angular rotation of earth
for a point source, fringe amplitude is independent of time
if get two sources, amplitude depends on angular separation of the two sources, relative to the maxima and minima of the signal.
for extended sources, want a source that is small to get more amplitude. a large source about the size of the fringe spacing is going to have 0 amplitude.
a circular sun complicates this a little
sun gets (larger) as wavelength gets bigger, optical depth stuff. outside optical edge, temperature goes up, so it looks brighter on the outside.
